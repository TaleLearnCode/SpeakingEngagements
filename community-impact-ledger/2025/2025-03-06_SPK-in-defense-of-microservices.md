### Session Details

Design patterns are heralded as essential tools for solving recurring problems and creating maintainable, scalable, and robust systems. However, not all design patterns are created equal. Some widely respected patterns may inadvertently increase complexity, decrease maintainability, and even hinder productivity. 

In this 75-minute presentation, attendees will dive into the often-overlooked downsides of design patterns. We’ll address specific patterns that may cause more work than they are worth, examining real-world scenarios where these patterns result in unintended consequences—such as convoluted code, performance bottlenecks, and difficult debugging. The session will also present actionable strategies to mitigate these drawbacks, helping developers make better architectural decisions.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- **Identify Problematic Patterns:** Learn to recognize design patterns that may introduce more complexity than benefits.  
- **Understand Real-World Implications:** Gain insights into the consequences of misapplied or overused design patterns in practical scenarios.  
- **Develop Mitigation Strategies:** Discover actionable techniques to minimize the negative impact of problematic patterns, improving overall design effectiveness.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- A balanced perspective on popular design patterns and their potential drawbacks.  
- Strategies to optimize architectural decisions for maintainability and productivity.  
- Insights into evaluating and balancing trade-offs in software design.

**Tags:** Design Patterns, Software Design, Architecture, Developer Tools, .NET
