### Session Details

Durable Functions is an open-source extension to Azure Functions that enables long-running orchestrations and stateful processes to execute as serverless functions. In this session, you will learn about the common use patterns of Durable Functions, how to implement them, and the best practices for writing orchestrations—whether simple or complex—in a .NET environment.

Throughout this 45-minute session, attendees will explore:
- **Core Concepts:** An in-depth look at Durable Functions' capabilities for orchestrating serverless workflows.
- **Common Patterns:** How to implement application patterns such as function chaining, fan-out/fan-in, and async HTTP APIs.
- **Best Practices and Use Cases:** Real-world examples that highlight how to streamline workflow orchestration to improve scalability and resilience.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- **Understand Core Concepts:** Grasp the fundamental principles and benefits of Azure Durable Functions for orchestrating serverless workflows in .NET.  
- **Implement Common Patterns:** Learn how to apply patterns such as function chaining, fan-out/fan-in, and async HTTP APIs using Durable Functions.  
- **Leverage Best Practices:** Gain insights into practical, real-world use cases and best practices to enhance application scalability and resilience.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- A comprehensive understanding of how Durable Functions extend the capabilities of Azure Functions for long-running orchestrations.  
- Practical strategies to implement and manage stateful workflows in serverless environments.  
- Valuable insights into optimizing orchestration patterns to improve overall application performance.
