**Finding Bigfoot with JavaScript + Vector Search**

I've written a rather silly thing using AI and JavaScript that finds Bigfoot using Semantic Search. In this session I'll show it to you!
I'll show you the code I used to trigger the Semantic Search. Not sure what Semantic Search is? Well, it uses embeddings to search for what you intended as opposed to keywords. This lets it understand the context of your request. Not sure what embeddings are? An embedding is a very carefully constructed vector created using an AI model. How can vectors do that? Guess you're gonna have to come and find out!

If that's not enough, I'm using buzzwords like LLM, LangChain, Hugging Face, Redis, and Vector Database. So you better come and learn what all that stuff is too!
