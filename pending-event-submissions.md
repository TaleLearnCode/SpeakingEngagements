I am utilizing this page to track my event submissions. Primarily, it serves my personal and organizational needs, aiding in recalling where I've applied. However, it also offers insight to those impressed by the volume of speaking engagements I do and just how many events I have to submit to to get to that number.

This page contains the pending event submissions—events that I have submitted and am still waiting to hear back from. See the main [Event Submissions](event-submissions.md) page for all of my submissions.
