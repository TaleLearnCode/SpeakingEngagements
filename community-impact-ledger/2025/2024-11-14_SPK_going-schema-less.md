### Session Details

There can be many great benefits to developing with a NoSQL database over a relational database. In this presentation, you will learn about those benefits—along with the potential pitfalls. We will demonstrate how to take relationally developed data, restructure it into a NoSQL database (with an emphasis on Cosmos DB), and develop a .NET application to work with that data.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- **Evaluate Pros and Cons:** Understand the advantages and potential challenges when switching from relational to NoSQL models.  
- **Data Migration Techniques:** Learn practical methods to migrate data from a relational database to a NoSQL data model.  
- **Application Development:** Discover how to build a .NET application that leverages a Cosmos DB NoSQL data model for enhanced scalability and flexibility.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- A clear understanding of the benefits and challenges of adopting a schema-less approach.  
- Practical strategies for executing data migration and restructuring databases using NoSQL.  
- Actionable insights into developing scalable .NET applications powered by Cosmos DB.

**Tags:** NoSQL, Cosmos DB, .NET, Database Migration, Developer Tools
