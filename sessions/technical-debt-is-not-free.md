# Technical Debt Is Not Free

![Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen) üó£Ô∏èTalk üü¢ Introductory

**Abstract:**  
So many software development teams inadvertently accumulate technical debt without realizing the long-term consequences. Even when teams recognize and document their technical debt, failing to take action can expose them to significant challenges. In this session, we explore the concept of technical debt and why reporting it is only the first step. More importantly, we‚Äôll uncover actionable strategies for addressing and reducing technical debt, ensuring that short-term expedience does not snowball into long-term setbacks. You‚Äôll learn how to properly track, manage, and repay technical debt to maintain a healthy, sustainable codebase through real-world examples and case studies.

## Overview

Technical debt is much like financial debt in software development: if left unmanaged, it can lead to inevitable problems and expensive "interest payments" over time. This presentation takes a deep dive into the nuances of technical debt, explaining its origins, exploring practical methods for documentation, and, most crucially, outlining strategies to address and reduce it. With insights from real-world projects, the session is designed to help emerging and experienced engineering teams build sustainable practices that prevent technical debt from undermining long-term productivity and quality.

#### Elevator Pitch

Learn how to identify, document, and actively manage technical debt to safeguard your projects from long-term pitfalls, transforming potential liabilities into opportunities for continuous improvement.

## Conference-Specific Customizations

Some conferences require adjustments to the presentation details to better align with their themes or audience. Below are the variations applied for specific event submissions.

### Prairie Dev Con Winnipeg 2025

**Title:** Technical Debt Is Not Free  
**Abstract:**  
In our early rush to ship features, we unknowingly let quick fixes pile up until our codebase started screaming for attention. In this session, I'll share our candid journey of discovering that technical debt isn't free‚Äîit compounds, turning short-term expedience into long-term setbacks. Through real-world examples and case studies, I'll show how we learned to track, manage, and repay our debt before it crippled our projects. You‚Äôll leave with actionable strategies and a clear blueprint to maintain a healthy, sustainable codebase, ensuring that each decision today sets you up for tomorrow‚Äôs success.

**Elevator Pitch:**  
Quick fixes quickly add up. Discover our journey of confronting hidden technical debt before it crippled our codebase‚Äîand learn actionable strategies to track, manage, and repay it for a sustainable future.
