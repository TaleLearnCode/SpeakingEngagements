![Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen) üó£Ô∏èTalk üîµ Intermediate

**Abstract:**  

Modern applications demand APIs that can withstand failures and dynamically scale to meet demand. In this session, we‚Äôll explore how **Azure API Management, Azure Functions, and Azure Container Apps** can help design resilient and scalable APIs that remain operational under pressure.

- **High Availability & Disaster Recovery:** Architecting APIs to ensure seamless failover and minimal downtime.
- **Resilience Strategies:** To enhance reliability, implement **retry policies, circuit breakers, and throttling**.
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Using **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** for real-time performance tracking.
- **Live Demo & Real-World Scenarios:** Watch Azure tools in action as we integrate resilience techniques into a scalable API framework.

Whether you‚Äôre a **developer, architect, or IT professional**, this session provides actionable strategies for **future-proofing your APIs and optimizing their reliability in cloud-native environments**.

### APICon New York 2025

**Title:** Scaling APIs Like a City That Never Sleeps: Building Resilient APIs in Azure  
**Abstract:**  
Like New York City thrives on its interconnected infrastructure, high availability, and adaptability, modern APIs must scale effortlessly and remain resilient under pressure. This session will explore how Azure API Management, Azure Functions, and Azure Container Apps provide the foundation for high-performing, fault-tolerant APIs, like the systems that power the city itself.

- **Surviving Peak Traffic:** Strategies for auto-scaling APIs during high-demand periods, like rush hour in Manhattan.
- **Resilient Architecture:** Implementing retry policies, circuit breakers, and throttling to withstand unexpected failures, like how NYC keeps running through disruptions.
- **Observability & Monitoring:** Azure Monitor and Application Insights are used to gain insights and keep APIs functioning smoothly, just as the city relies on real-time data to manage operations.
- **Live Demo & Real-World Scenarios:** This demo showcases Azure-powered API resilience in action, mirroring how critical infrastructure in New York is built for scalability and reliability.

Whether you‚Äôre an architect, developer, or IT leader, this session will equip you with strategies for keeping your APIs running like a city's heartbeat‚Äîfast, scalable, and resilient.
