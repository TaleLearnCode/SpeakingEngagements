### Session Details

There can be a lot of great benefits to developing with a NoSQL database over a relational database. In this presentation, you'll learn about those benefits as well as the potential pitfalls. Through live demonstrations, this session will show how to take relationally developed data, restructure it into a NoSQL database—using Cosmos DB in particular—and develop a .NET application that works with that data.

By the end of the session, participants will understand the trade-offs between relational and NoSQL data models, learn practical techniques for data migration, and gain insights into building robust, scalable .NET applications powered by Cosmos DB.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- **Evaluate Pros and Cons:** Learn about the advantages and potential pitfalls of transitioning from a relational model to a NoSQL data model.  
- **Data Migration Techniques:** Understand how to effectively migrate data from a relational database to a NoSQL model using Cosmos DB.  
- **Application Development:** Discover how to develop a .NET application that utilizes a Cosmos DB NoSQL data model for enhanced scalability and flexibility.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Insight into the benefits and challenges of adopting a NoSQL approach over traditional relational databases.  
- Practical strategies for executing data migration with Cosmos DB.  
- Skills to implement a scalable .NET application leveraging the power of a NoSQL backend.

**Tags:** NoSQL, Cosmos DB, .NET, Database Migration, Developer Tools
