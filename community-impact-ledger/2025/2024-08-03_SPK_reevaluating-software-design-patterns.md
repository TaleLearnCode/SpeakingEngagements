### Session Details

Design patterns are potent tools in software development for solving recurring problems and building robust systems. However, not all design patterns are created equal—some, despite their stellar reputations, can increase complexity, reduce maintainability, and hinder productivity.

In this 50-minute session, we critically examine design patterns that may do more harm than good. Attendees will explore real-world scenarios where established patterns introduce unnecessary complexity, performance bottlenecks, or convoluted code. The presentation emphasizes the importance of evaluating pattern applicability and shares practical strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of over-engineering.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- **Identify Over-Engineered Patterns:** Recognize design patterns that can introduce more complexity than benefits.  
- **Understand Real-World Implications:** Analyze the consequences of misapplying certain patterns in practical scenarios.  
- **Mitigate Negative Impacts:** Learn strategies and best practices to avoid or reduce the drawbacks associated with problematic design patterns.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Clear criteria to evaluate when a design pattern is beneficial versus when it may be a burden.  
- Practical insights to avoid over-engineering and simplify complex codebases.  
- Actionable strategies to improve maintainability and overall software quality.
