## Conference-Specific Customizations

Some conferences require adjustments to the presentation details to better align with their themes or audience. Below are the variations applied for specific event submissions.

### Techoroma Netherlands 2025  

**Title:** Messaging Playbook: Winning Patterns for a Championship Cloud Architecture  
**Abstract:**  
Building a cloud architecture that scales, responds, and thrives under pressure is like coaching a winning sports team. Success depends on selecting the right strategies‚Äîmessaging patterns that allow services to collaborate seamlessly, react in real-time, and handle unpredictable events with resilience. In this session, we'll explore key messaging paradigms‚ÄîPoint-to-Point, Publish-Subscribe, Message Queues, Request-Reply, Event Sourcing, and Saga Patterns‚Äîthrough the lens of sports strategy. You'll see these patterns in action, like how championship teams use coordination, agility, and persistence to outperform their competition. Whether designing a microservices-based architecture or fine-tuning your cloud application, you‚Äôll gain playbook-worthy techniques to make your system as adaptable and effective as a well-trained athlete.

### Prairie Dev Con 2025

**Title:** Silos to Symphony: Our Journey with Messaging Patterns in the Cloud

**Abstract**:  
Our cloud architecture once struggled with disjointed communication and brittle integrations. When our systems began to falter, we turned to messaging patterns as our salvation. Through trial and error, we discovered that embracing paradigms‚Äîfrom classic Point-to-Point to the innovative Saga pattern‚Äîcould transform our scattered components into a harmonized, resilient system.

In this session, I‚Äôll share the rollercoaster story behind our transformation. I‚Äôll recount early missteps and breakthrough moments that drove us to reimagine data flows and communication channels. Expect to dive into hands-on case studies where simple messaging turned a failing system into one that scales gracefully, adapts dynamically, and withstands disruptions. This isn‚Äôt just a technical exploration; it‚Äôs a narrative of how real-world challenges spurred us to adopt messaging patterns that unlocked unprecedented performance and reliability in our cloud solutions.
