## Description

**The Dark Side of Design Patterns: What They Don't Tell You**

Design patterns are potent tools in software development that solve recurring problems and are essential for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust systems. However, not all design patterns are created equal. Some well-respected patterns may inadvertently lead to increased complexity, decreased maintainability, and hinder productivity.

Join us as we explore specific design patterns that can cause more work than they are worth. Through real-world scenarios, we will uncover how these patterns can lead to unintended consequences such as convoluted code, performance bottlenecks, and intricate debugging sessions.
