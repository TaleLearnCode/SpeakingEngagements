### Session Details

You have heard all the buzzwords—microservices, event-driven architecture, serverless, etc. You've likely attended sessions that discuss these concepts, but how do you put them all together?

In this full-day workshop, you'll start by designing a solution using serverless and event-driven cloud services combined with microservice patterns. Next, you'll build that solution using .NET, Azure services, and other best-practice tools. Finally, you'll deploy the solution to the cloud so that customers can benefit from a well-architected, reliable, and scalable system that meets present needs while accommodating future growth.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- **Understand Integration:** Learn how different serverless and event-driven cloud services can be integrated to build a cohesive microservice-based architecture.  
- **Build with Best Practices:** Gain hands-on experience in constructing a working solution using proven best practices and real-world insights on what works—and what doesn’t.  
- **Deploy Effectively:** Acquire practical skills in deploying your solution using continuous integration and continuous development tools to keep it up-to-date.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- A clear methodology for combining serverless, microservices, and event-driven design into a unified solution.  
- Practical steps to build an end-to-end system using .NET and Azure tools.  
- Strategies for deploying and maintaining a resilient and scalable cloud solution.
