# Mastering Microservices API Management with Azure APIM

![Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen) üó£Ô∏èTalk üîµ Intermediate

**Abstract:**  
Microservices architectures thrive on scalability and flexibility and introduce security, governance, and observability challenges. In this session, we‚Äôll explore how Azure API Management (APIM) is the central gateway for harmonizing microservices, ensuring secure API communication, lifecycle management, and operational monitoring.

Drawing from real-world implementations, I‚Äôll demonstrate:

- **Security & Access Control:** Enforcing best practices for authentication, rate limiting, and compliance.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Leveraging built-in telemetry to optimize API performance.
- **Integration Strategies:** Seamlessly connecting disparate microservices through APIM.
- **Lessons Learned:** Insights from deploying APIM in high-demand enterprise environments.

Through live demonstrations and real-world examples, attendees will gain practical strategies to streamline microservice API management, enhance security, and optimize performance. Whether you're a developer, architect, or business leader, this talk will equip you with the tools to elevate your API strategy.
