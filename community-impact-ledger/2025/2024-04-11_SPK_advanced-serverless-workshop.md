### Session Details

Have you been doing serverless for a while but don’t feel like you’re getting the most out of it? This interactive workshop will allow you to interact with experienced serverless professionals and get three different perspectives on how to level up your serverless architecture.

- Learn new approaches and design patterns.
- Hear stories from the trenches about what worked (and what didn’t)
- Gain perspective on cost, performance, scalability, and resilience.
- Includes examples covering AWS Lambda, Azure Function, and Google Functions

This four-part workshop is designed for experienced serverless developers and architects who want to deepen their knowledge, learn exciting new aspects of serverless technology, and network with other serverless experts. Some perspectives on the major platforms will be provided, but this workshop is intended for all practitioners, regardless of their current technology stack.

**Learning Objectives:**  

- Understand Azure serverless architecture design patterns and best practices.  
- Equip participants with hands-on strategies to build scalable, resilient applications on Azure.  
- Gain insights into multi-platform serverless strategies through expert panel discussions.

**Key Takeaways:**  

- Innovative design patterns and approaches to level up serverless solutions.  
- Practical tactics for improving cost, performance, scalability, and resilience.  
- Actionable insights drawn from both interactive lab exercises and panel discussions.

**Tags:** Serverless, Azure, Workshop, Panel, Cloud, Architecture, .NET, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Compute Infrastructure

| **Description**                 | This Advanced Serverless Workshop provided an interactive, four-part deep dive into serverless architectures for experienced developers. In Unit 2, I presented "Azure Serverless Solutions Demystified," exploring design patterns, cloud design patterns, and real-world examples of leveraging Azure’s serverless capabilities. Additionally, I served as a panelist on Unit 4 – the Serverless Discussion Panel – joining experts from AWS and GCP to share insights on multi-platform strategies. The session empowered participants to learn new approaches, optimize cost and scalability, and gain practical guidance on building resilient serverless applications. |
