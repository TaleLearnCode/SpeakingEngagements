## Description

Join Jes Schultz a CSA with Microsoft with over a decade of Azure data experience as she guides you through the questions to ask to determine which Azure database to choose for your applications, so you can save time, money, and frustration in the long run.

When you need a managed database in Azure, you're faced with a variety of choices. Is your data relational or not? Do you want SQL Database, PostgreSQL, or MySQL? What is Cosmos DB and why does it have five APIs? When should you use Azure Cache for Redis? Do all of these database options have the same compute and storage options? Do they provide the PaaS management tasks you want?
