### Session Details

By now, you've likely seen the HTTP trigger in Azure Functions – the go-to demo for showcasing its power. But Azure Functions is much more versatile, featuring a wide range of triggers and bindings that enable you to solve diverse needs. In this 60-minute session, we dive beyond the familiar "Hello World" and explore these additional capabilities.

Attendees will learn about:
- **Non-HTTP triggers and bindings:** Discover how to leverage other triggers (e.g., Timer, Blob, Queue) and bindings to build dynamic, event-driven applications.
- **Real-World Use Cases:** See examples of how various triggers and bindings are employed to address unique customer challenges.
- **Durable Functions Extensions:** Learn how to use the Durable Functions extension to orchestrate complex workflows and take your applications beyond what you thought possible.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn about the different Azure Function triggers and bindings beyond the HTTP trigger.  
- See real-world examples of how Azure Functions have been used to solve practical needs.  
- Discover how to use the Durable Functions extension to build orchestration processes that extend Azure Functions’ capabilities.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- A deeper understanding of Azure Functions' versatile triggers and bindings.  
- Practical insights into applying cutting-edge features like Durable Functions in real-world scenarios.  
- Strategies to leverage these capabilities for building scalable, robust, and innovative cloud applications.
