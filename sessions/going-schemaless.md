## Overview

Relational databases have long been the standard for structured data management, but the rise of NoSQL databases offers new opportunities for scalability, flexibility, and performance. While schema-less databases eliminate many constraints, migrating an existing relational system introduces unique challenges that developers must address. This session breaks down the key considerations for transitioning from SQL-based systems to NoSQL, offering real-world guidance on data transformation, query restructuring, and ensuring application compatibility.

Attendees will understand how to structure migration efforts, leverage NoSQL advantages without compromising data integrity, and make informed decisions about when to use a polyglot persistence model that integrates relational and NoSQL databases.

#### Elevator Pitch

Migrating to NoSQL? Learn how to transition from relational databases smoothly, optimize data strategies, and harness the power of schema-less scalability.

## Audience & Engagement

This talk is designed for software developers, data architects, and cloud engineers evaluating NoSQL databases or actively working on database migrations. A basic understanding of SQL and database principles is helpful but not required. The session will engage participants through live demonstrations, Q&A interactions, and real-world migration scenarios. Attendees can provide feedback via LinkedIn, Twitter, or GitHub.

## Conference-Specific Customizations

Some conferences require adjustments to the presentation details to better align with their themes or audience. Below are the variations applied for specific event submissions.

### Techoroma Netherlands 2025

**Title:** üö¥ Pedaling Towards NoSQL: Shifting Gears for Scalable Data Architecture 
**Abstract:**  
Migrating from a relational database to NoSQL is like switching from a classic Dutch city bike to a high-performance racing cycle‚Äîit requires adapting to a new pace, handling data differently, and optimizing for efficiency. While traditional SQL databases offer structured, predictable pathways, NoSQL brings **agility**, **flexibility**, and **scalability**, akin to navigating open roads rather than rigid cycle lanes.

This session explores how to **shift gears** smoothly during migration, ensuring data flows seamlessly without losing control. We‚Äôll cover key NoSQL benefits like horizontal scaling and schema flexibility, while also tackling the roadblocks developers encounter during migration. Using real-world case studies, we‚Äôll provide the **route map** to help attendees steer clear of common pitfalls and **ride** their data architecture toward speed and adaptability. Whether coasting through database transitions or sprinting toward cloud-native applications, this talk will prepare you to cycle ahead confidently!
