I am utilizing this page to track my event submissions. Primarily, it serves my personal and organizational needs, aiding in recalling where I've applied. However, it also offers insight to those impressed by the volume of speaking engagements I do and just how many events I have to submit to to get to that number.

If you want to see just what is pending, please check the [Pending Event Submissions](pending-event-submissions.md) page.
