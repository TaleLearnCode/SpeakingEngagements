### Prairie Dev Con Winnipeg 2025

**Title:** From Outage to Triumph: Our Journey Building Resilient APIs in Azure

**Abstract:**  
Modern APIs need more than technical prowess‚Äîthey must endure tough, real-world challenges. In this session, I‚Äôll share how our team turned a crisis into an innovation opportunity. When an unexpected outage put our service to the test, we were forced to rethink our approach using Azure API Management, Azure Functions, and Azure Container Apps. We leaned into comprehensive high availability and disaster recovery strategies to ensure seamless failover and minimal downtime.

I‚Äôll walk you through how we implemented resilience techniques like retry policies, circuit breakers, and throttling methods that didn‚Äôt just temporarily patch issues but transformed our system. Along the way, you‚Äôll see how live monitoring with Azure Monitor and Application Insights kept us in the loop during critical moments and helped us learn valuable lessons for future improvements.

**Elevator Pitch:**  
Surviving an outage isn‚Äôt enough‚Äîthriving after one is the real challenge. I‚Äôll reveal how we transformed a crisis into a resilient, scalable API framework using Azure. Learn hard-won lessons, see real-world solutions in action, and leave equipped to future-proof your cloud-native applications.
