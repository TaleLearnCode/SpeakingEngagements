### Session Details

Design patterns are potent tools in software development that solve recurring problems and help create maintainable, scalable systems. However, not all design patterns are created equal; some well-respected patterns may inadvertently increase complexity, reduce maintainability, and even hinder productivity.

In this 60-minute session, we delve into software design patterns that—despite their historical importance—can sometimes cause more harm than benefit. Join us as we explore patterns that have earned their place in software engineering history but may only occasionally live up to their reputation. We will discuss real-world scenarios where the misuse or over-application of these patterns leads to unintended consequences such as convoluted code, performance bottlenecks, and intricate debugging sessions.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- **Identify Problematic Patterns:** Recognize design patterns that may introduce more complexity than benefits.  
- **Understand Real-World Implications:** Analyze the practical consequences of applying certain design patterns in various scenarios.  
- **Mitigate Negative Impacts:** Learn strategies and best practices to reduce or avoid the pitfalls associated with over-engineered design patterns.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- A framework for evaluating when a design pattern is beneficial versus when it may become a burden.  
- Practical strategies to avoid over-engineering and simplify codebases.  
- Insights into making more informed architectural choices to enhance overall software quality.
